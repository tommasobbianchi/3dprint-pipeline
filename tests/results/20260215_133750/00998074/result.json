  "prompt": "Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object that resembles a thermometer. Begin by sketching a circle with a diameter of 0.358436 units. At the edge of this circle, sketch a long thin rectangle with a length of 0.192347 units, a width of 0.592709 units, and a height that is approximately 7 times its width. Ensure that the bottom of the rectangle touches the circle but isn't fully merged, overlapping by 0.02193 units. Near the top edge of the rectangle, create a small circular hole with a diameter of 0.052367 units, positioned 0.048552 units from the edge of the rectangle. Ensure the sketch forms a closed area that can be extruded. Extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.029536 units to create the 3D object.",
