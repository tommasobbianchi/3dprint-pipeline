  "prompt": "Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object. Begin by sketching a square in the X-Y plane with dimensions 0.75 units by 0.75 units and extrude it along the Z-axis to a height of 0.25 units. Next, sketch another square at the top-right corner of the original square with dimensions approximately 0.15 units by 0.15 units (1/5th the size of the original), ensuring that their top-right corners touch. Negatively extrude this smaller square by 0.5 units, creating an effect where it appears as if a chunk is missing from the original extruded object.",
