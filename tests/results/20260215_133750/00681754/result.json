  "prompt": "Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that consists of a rectangular block with dimensions of length 1.09115 units, width 1.5 units, and height 0.361568 units. On top of this block, place a cylinder centered on the rectangle. The cylinder should have a diameter of 0.427203 units, which is approximately 1/4th of the rectangle's length, and should be extruded upwards by 0.271176 units. Start by creating a sketch of the rectangle and extruding it to form the block. Then, on the top face of this block, sketch a circle at the center and extrude it to form the cylinder.",
