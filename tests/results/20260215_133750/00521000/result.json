  "prompt": "Write Python code using CADQuery to create a ring with a height of 0.010714 units and an outer diameter of 1.5 units. The ring should have an inner diameter calculated by subtracting 0.342858 units (0.171429*2) from the outer diameter. Next, create three small circular holes within the ring, positioning them in a triangular formation. Each hole should have a diameter of 0.105429 units and be placed equidistant from each other, with their centers located at a radius of (outer diameter/2 - (outer diameter - inner diameter)/4) from the center of the ring. Rotate the final object by -90 degrees around the Z-axis to align it as needed.",
