  "prompt": "Write Python code using CADQuery to create two perpendicular rectangles resembling a door and its hinge, connected at one edge. The larger rectangle should have dimensions of 0.416808 units in length, 0.033235 units in width, and be extruded to a height of 0.75 units. Position this larger rectangle in the X-Y plane. The smaller rectangle should have dimensions of 0.211685 units in length, 0.065736 units in width, and be extruded to a height of 0.411987 units. This smaller rectangle should be positioned in the Y-Z plane, centered at the same point as the larger rectangle but rotated 90 degrees around the Z-axis. The smaller rectangle should also be translated such that it is connected at one edge to the larger rectangle, with a padding of 0.0065309 units from the base of the larger rectangle. Ensure that the smaller rectangle's length and width are approximately half that of the larger rectangle.",
