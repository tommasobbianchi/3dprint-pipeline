  "prompt": "Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that is a sliced cylinder with specific dimensions. First, create a cylinder with a diameter of 0.375 units and a height of 0.691189 units. Then, slice this cylinder at an angle using a cutting plane defined by points that transition from the base to the top of the cylinder, effectively removing approximately one-third of the material. The cutting plane starts at the base of the cylinder, extends up to the top with a length of 0.208765 units along the top, and then angles down to the opposite side at the base. Rotate and adjust the final object for proper orientation and positioning.",
